## User Story

```
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Given a webpage meets accessibility standards
When I view the source code
Then I find semantic HTML elements
When I view the structure of the HTML elements
Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
When I view the icon and image elements
Then I find accessible alt attributes
When I view the heading attributes
Then they fall in sequential order
When I view the title element
Then I find a concise, descriptive title
```
